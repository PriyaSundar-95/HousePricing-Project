🏡 House Price Prediction using Lasso Regression
Overview
This project aims to predict house prices using Lasso Regression by analyzing various structural, locational, and quality features of residential properties. The objective is to create a reliable and interpretable model that can support real estate decision-making.

📊 Dataset
The dataset includes:

Lot area, year built, overall quality
Number of bedrooms, bathrooms, garages
Zoning, neighborhood, and other location-related features
🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)
Lasso Regression (for feature selection and prediction)
Jupyter Notebook for experimentation and visualization
🔍 Workflow
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Feature Engineering
Lasso Regression Model Building
Model Evaluation using RMSE and cross-validation
📈 Results
The Lasso Regression model efficiently selected the most relevant features and performed well in predicting housing prices with a lower risk of overfitting.

📝 Conclusion
In this project, we built a house price prediction model using Lasso Regression to identify key features influencing property prices while minimizing overfitting. The model delivers accurate and interpretable results, making it a valuable tool for real estate analysis. With further enhancements like deployment and model comparisons, this solution can be extended for real-world applications.

🚀 Future Work
Deploy the model using Streamlit or Flask
Experiment with other models like Random Forest and XGBoost
Add real-time prediction capability with user input
